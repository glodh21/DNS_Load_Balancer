# DNS Load Balancer Integration Summary

## What Was Created

### Main Integration File
**File**: `src/main/main_dnsdist_lb.cpp`

This is the **main entry point** that connects the PowerDNS/dnsdist load balancing algorithms with your existing DNS server architecture.

**Key Components**:

1. **DnsdistLoadBalancer Class**
   - Wraps dnsdist load balancing policies
   - Integrates with your HealthChecker
   - Manages backend server pools
   - Provides policy selection (roundrobin, leastOutstanding, etc.)
   - Tracks query statistics

2. **DnsServer Class**
   - Boost.Asio UDP DNS server
   - LDNS for DNS packet parsing
   - Integrates with DnsdistLoadBalancer
   - Handles DNS queries and responses

3. **Main Function**
   - Command-line policy selection
   - Configuration loading
   - Health checker initialization
   - Multi-threaded DNS server startup

## How It Works

```
DNS Query → DnsServer → DnsdistLoadBalancer → Select Backend (using dnsdist policy)
                                   ↓
                            Check with HealthChecker
                                   ↓
                            Return healthy backend IP
                                   ↓
                         Send DNS response with backend IP
```

## Build Configuration

**Updated**: `CMakeLists.txt`

Added new target `aiori-dnsdist` that:
- Compiles `main_dnsdist_lb.cpp`
- Links with dnsdist load balancing code
- Includes all necessary dependencies (Boost, LDNS, CURL)

## Documentation

1. **README_DNSDIST.md**: Comprehensive user guide
   - Feature overview
   - Build instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Policy explanations
   - Architecture diagram
   - Troubleshooting

2. **build_and_run.sh**: Automated build script
   - Creates build directory
   - Runs CMake and Make
   - Optionally runs the server
   - Shows usage instructions

3. **test_load_balancing.sh**: Testing script
   - Sends multiple DNS queries
   - Collects and analyzes results
   - Shows load distribution statistics

## Load Balancing Policies

The integration supports all major dnsdist policies:

1. **roundrobin**: Even distribution across backends
2. **leastOutstanding**: Route to least loaded backend
3. **wrandom**: Weighted random selection
4. **whashed**: Weighted consistent hashing
5. **chashed**: Consistent hashing
6. **firstAvailable**: Active/passive failover

## Usage

### Build
```bash
cd DNS_Load_Balancer
./build_and_run.sh
```

### Run with different policies
```bash
# Round-robin (default)
./build/aiori-dnsdist

# Least outstanding
./build/aiori-dnsdist leastOutstanding

# Consistent hashing
./build/aiori-dnsdist chashed
```

### Test
```bash
# Send 20 test queries
./test_load_balancing.sh 20
```

## File Structure

```
DNS_Load_Balancer/
├── src/main/
│   └── main_dnsdist_lb.cpp       ← NEW: Main integration file
├── load_balancing/
│   ├── dnsdist-lbpolicies.hh/cc  ← dnsdist algorithms
│   └── dnsdist-backend.hh        ← Backend management
├── CMakeLists.txt                ← UPDATED: Added aiori-dnsdist target
├── README_DNSDIST.md             ← NEW: User documentation

## Key Features

✅ **Production-grade algorithms**: Uses actual dnsdist code
✅ **Health-aware**: Only routes to healthy backends
✅ **Flexible policies**: Choose algorithm at runtime
✅ **Statistics tracking**: Monitor query distribution
✅ **Multi-threaded**: High-performance Boost.Asio
✅ **Easy testing**: Includes test scripts

## What's Different from Original

### Original (`dns-idk.cpp`)
- Simple custom LoadBalancer class
- Basic round-robin only
- Minimal statistics

### New (`main_dnsdist_lb.cpp`)
- Full dnsdist load balancing integration
- 6+ advanced policies
- Health-aware routing
- Detailed statistics
- Policy selection at runtime

## Next Steps

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   ./build_and_run.sh
   ```

2. **Test with different policies**:
   ```bash
   ./build/aiori-dnsdist roundrobin &
   ./test_load_balancing.sh 20
   ```

3. **Compare results** with different policies to see how they distribute load

4. **Configure backend pools** in `config.json`

5. **Monitor performance** - Check statistics on shutdown (Ctrl+C)

## Architecture Integration

The new main file successfully integrates:

- ✅ Your existing DNS server (Boost.Asio + LDNS)
- ✅ Your configuration system (ConfigLoader)
- ✅ Your health checking (HealthChecker)
- ✅ PowerDNS/dnsdist algorithms (dnsdist-lbpolicies)

All without changing the core dnsdist logic! 🎉

## Benefits

1. **Best of both worlds**: Your DNS server + dnsdist algorithms
2. **Minimal changes**: Preserves all existing functionality
3. **Easy to extend**: Add more policies or features
4. **Production ready**: Battle-tested algorithms from PowerDNS
5. **Well documented**: Complete guide and examples

## Troubleshooting

If compilation fails, check:
- All header files are present in `load_balancing/`
- CMake finds Boost, LDNS, and CURL
- C++17 compiler is available

If runtime fails, check:
- Backend servers are configured
- Health check endpoints are accessible
- Port 5353 is available (or run as root for port 53)
